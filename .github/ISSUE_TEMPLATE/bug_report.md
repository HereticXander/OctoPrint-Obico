**Note**
Most of the times, an issue you may potentially run into is not a bug. Instead, it is related to configurations, such as the OctoPrint settings, network connectivity, webcam model, etc.

If you are not sure, please don't open a bug report here. Instead, you can get the issue solved much faster by seeking help in our support forum: https://obico.io/discord

Proceed to opening a bug report only if you are sure it is a defect in the code given a correct configuration.
